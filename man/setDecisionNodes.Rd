\title{Classify Multiple Nodes as Decision or Utility Nodes}
\usage{
setDecisionNodes(network, ...)

setUtilityNodes(network, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A Hyde Network object}

\item{...}{Networks to be classified as decision nodes.  These may be quoted
or unquoted.}
}
\description{
Depending on how your Hyde Network was built, you may not have
  had the opportunity to declare which nodes are decision or utlity nodes.  
  For instance,
  when passing a list of models, there is no way to indicate in the model
  object that the node should be considered a decision node.  As a matter 
  of convenience, these function will set any nodes indicated to decision 
  or utility nodes.  It will make no other modifications to a node's definition.
